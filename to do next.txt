Upcoming tasks:
- Over-ons admin slider preview still shows only one image; frontend carousel works, backend preview must mirror same design/rotation.
- Seed AboutBenefit records (and other about-page content blocks) so edit buttons appear with real data.
- Extend inline editing pattern to the remaining diensten pages per plan.
- Clean up snapshot_files.txt or add it to .gitignore to keep git status tidy.
